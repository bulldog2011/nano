 * 
 * Variations are multiple similar (but not identical) items in a 
 * single fixed-price (or Store Inventory Format) listing. 
 * For example, a single listing could contain multiple items of the 
 * same brand and model that vary by color and size (like "Blue, Large" and "Black, Medium"). Each variation can have its own quantity and 
 * price. For example, a listing could include 10 "Blue, Large" 
 * variations and 20 "Black, Medium" variations.
