/**
 * 
 * Retrieves eBay IDs and codes (e.g., site IDs and shipping service
 * codes), enumerated data (e.g., payment methods), and other common eBay
 * meta-data. This call enables you to keep certain data up to date in your
 * applications without referring to the schema, the documentation, or the
 * eBay online help. Other data is returned for your reference, but you may
 * need to refer to the schema or the documentation for information about
 * valid values and usage.
 * <br><br>
 * In some cases, the data returned in the response will vary according to
 * the site that you use for the request.
 * <br><br>
 * If you use GeteBayDetails in preparation for listing in the US Motors Parts
 * and Accessories categories, use site ID 0 (which is the site ID of the US
 * site) when you call GeteBayDetails.
 * <br><br>
 * Sellers who engage in cross-border trade on sites that require a recoupment agreement, must agree to the
 * recoupment terms before adding items to the site. This agreement allows eBay to reimburse
 * a buyer during a dispute and then recoup the cost from the seller. Information about whether a site
 *         is a recoupment site is returned in the GeteBayDetailsResponse.RecoupmentPolicyDetails container.
