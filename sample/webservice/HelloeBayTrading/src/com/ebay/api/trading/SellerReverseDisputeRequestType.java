/**
 * 
 * Enables a seller to "reverse" an Unpaid Item dispute that has been closed, for
 * example, if buyer and seller reach an agreement. The seller's Final Value Fee
 * credit and the buyer's strike are both reversed, if applicable.
 * The dispute might have resulted
 * in a strike to the buyer and a Final Value Fee credit to the seller. A buyer and
 * seller sometimes come to agreement after a dispute has been closed. In particular,
 * the seller might discover that the buyer actually paid, or the buyer might agree
 * to pay the seller's fees in exchange for having the strike removed.
 * <br><br>
 * A dispute can only be reversed if it was closed with DisputeActivity set to
 * SellerEndCommunication, CameToAgreementNeedFVFCredit, or
 * MutualAgreementOrNoBuyerResponse.
