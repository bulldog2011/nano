/**
 * 
 * Returns a summary of pending or paid payments that Half.com created for the seller
 * identified by the authentication token in the request. Only returns payments that
 * occurred within a particular pay period. Each payment is for one transaction for
 * one item in one order. An order can contain transactions for multiple items from
 * multiple sellers, but this call only retrieves payments that are relevant to one
 * seller. Payments are only issued for items and transactions that the seller has
 * confirmed (see the Half.com online help for details). The financial value of a
 * payment is typically based on an amount that a buyer paid to Half.com for a
 * transaction, plus the shipping cost the buyer paid to Half.com for the item, minus
 * Half.com's commission. For most sellers, each month contains two pay periods: One
 * from the 1st to the 15th of the month, and one from the 16th to the last day of
 * the month. Payments are submitted to the seller's financial institution a certain
 * number of days after the current pay period ends (see the Half.com online help for
 * details).
