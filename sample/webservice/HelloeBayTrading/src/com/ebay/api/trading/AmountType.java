/**
 * 
 * An eBay-defined complex type for specifying monetary amounts.
 * <br><br>
 * A double value (e.g., 1.00 or 1.0) is meaningful as a monetary amount when accompanied by a specification of the currency, in which case the value specifies the amount in that currency. An AmountType expresses both the value (a double) and the currency.
 * <br><br>
 * The AmountType data type is typically used to specify details such as prices, fees, costs, and payments. In some cases, a whole number (i.e., without a period) can be passed or returned as a monetary value. This is necessary to support certain currencies that are only expressed as whole numbers (like the Italian Lira and Spanish Peseta).
 * <br><br>
 * Because a double is used to represent the amount, this also means whole monetary amounts may be returned with only one 0 after the decimal. For example, a dollar value could be returned as 1.0 instead of 1.00 in calls like AddItem. For fields of type AmountType, see the individual topics for specific restrictions beyond this.
